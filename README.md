# react-native-palette

A React-Native library which extracts prominent colors from an image. On Android, it wraps the [Android Pallete Class](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/graphics/Palette.html). On iOS, it uses code from [react-native-color-grabber](https://github.com/bsudekum/react-native-color-grabber).

 An example app is included.

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-palette --save`

or

`yarn add react-native-palette`

## For use on React-Native >= 0.60.0

Use version >= 1.0.0 of this package, which supports autolinking. No further installation steps are required.

## For use on React-Native < 0.60.0

Use version 0.4.x of this package and follow linking steps below:

### Mostly automatic installation for Android and iOS

`$ react-native link react-native-palette`


### Manual installation

#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
  - Add `import io.palette.RNPalettePackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new RNPalettePackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

  ```
   include ':react-native-palette'
   project(':react-native-palette').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-palette/android')
  ```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
```
   compile project(':react-native-palette')
```


#### iOS

1. Add `node_modules/react-native-palette/ios/RNPalette.xcodeproj` to your Xcode project

## API

### `getAllSwatches(options, image, (error, swatches) => {})`

#### options
An object containing option properties.
These properties are valid for iOS only. On Android, this parameter is ignored.

Property | Type | Info
-------- | ---- | ----
`threshold` | Float | Determines whether white or black text will be selected to contrast with the selected color. It is the value for `L`, in the complex formula at the end of this [StackOverflow comment](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3943023/1404185). The default value is 0.179.
`quality` | String | One of "low", "medium", or "high". Higher quality extracts more colors, takes more time and consumes more memory. Default is "low".
`alpha` | Float | From 0 to 1. Determine alpha of hex property. Default is 1. This value is multiplied by the alpha returned from the underlying platform-specific code. It does not affect the alpha of the `color` (rgba), `titleTextColor`, or `bodyTextColor` fields.

#### image
A path to an image such as that returned by [`react-native-image-picker`](https://github.com/marcshilling/react-native-image-picker). For iOS use the `origURL` field of the image picker response for images from `assets-library://`. For Android use the `path` field. Also for IOS, you can use a local URI, such as that returned by `RNFS.LibraryDirectoryPath` in the [react-native-fs](https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs/) library.

For versions of [`react-native-image-picker`](https://github.com/marcshilling/react-native-image-picker) >= 3.0.0, use `response.assets[0].uri.slice(7)`


#### callback
The callback is passed an error parameter and an array of swatches representing the dominant colors in the image. Typically 16 swatches are returned on Android, fewer on iOS.

### `getNamedSwatches(image, (error, swatches) => {})`

Android only.

#### image

Same as in `getAllSwatches`

#### swatches

An object keyed by the qualities of colors defined by the Android `Palette` Class.
The keys are the following:

* "Vibrant"
* "Vibrant Dark"
* "Vibrant Light"
* "Muted"
* "Muted Dark"
* "Muted Light"

The values are swatches (possibly `null`) or with the fields defined below.


### Swatch Fields

Colors include alpha in the `react-native`  `rgba(255,255,255,1.0)` format. Note that on iOS10 devices UIExtendedSRGBColorSpace color values may be greater than 255 or less than 0, but they will render correctly on the device.

Field | Info
------ | ----
color | The main color of the swatch.
population | The dominance of this swatch in the image. You can sort on this field to find the most dominant swatch. Android: A positive integer. iOS: A floating point number between 0 and 1.
titleTextColor | A text color which contrasts well with the main swatch color for use in titles.
bodyTextColor | A text color which contrasts well with the main swatch color for use as body text.
swatchInfo | A string encapsulating all the above and more. Can be used for debugging. Android: Note that the hex strings are in the format `#aarrggbb` rather than the `react-native` format. iOS: the result string returned by the old (`react-native-color-grabber`) API.
hex | Hex code, computed from color, in format `#rrggbbaa` .

### Example
```javascript

  import {getAllSwatches} from 'react-native-palette';
  import ImagePicker from 'react-native-image-picker'

  ImagePicker.launchImageLibrary({}, (response)  => {
    var path =  Platform.OS === 'ios' ? response.origURL : response.path;
    getAllSwatches({}, path, (error, swatches) => {
      if (error) {
        console.log(error);
      } else {
        swatches.sort((a, b) => {
          return b.population - a.population;
        });
        swatches.forEach((swatch) => {
          console.log(swatch.swatchInfo);
        });
      }
    });
  });
```
## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving `react-native-palette`. Please review the following requests before submitting your PR.

1. Test your change with the example app. The README file in the example directory explains an easy way to build and run it.
4. If you're adding a new feature, please add something in the example app to demonstrate it.
5. Please keep your changes concise and avoid unnecessary formatting/indentation changes. They make the diff difficult to understand and review. If you have an new idea for formatting that will save the world, by all means propose it, but at least include a `prettier` spec for automating it. This goes double for Java/Objective-C changes, since those are foreign languages to me.
1. In your PR, please give a brief explanation of the purpose, referencing Issues when appropriate, and mention whether your change will require a patch, minor or major semver bump.
6. Please document your changes in CHANGELOG.md.

Thanks again.
